- 👋 Hi, I’m Sydney @sydelled and I graduated with a Bachelor's in Information Systems. I have been interested in coding and website development since high school when I took my first computer programming class that taught visual basic. At that time, I didn't think to make a career out of my interest until much later when I decided to pursue my studies in the field. 
- 👀 I’m interested in reading, computers, video games, and yoga.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning website development, python, database management, and application development.
- 💞️ I would like to collaborate on a project in the future, but I'm currently working on my projects.
- 📫 You can reach me through linkedin.
