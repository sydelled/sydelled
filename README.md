- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Sydney @sydelled and I graduated with a Bachelor's in Information Systems. I have been interested in coding and website development since high school when I took my first computer programming class that taught visual basic. At that time, I didn't think to make a career out of my interest until much later when I decided to pursue my studies in the field. 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in reading, computers, video games, and yoga.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently woring with testing automation in Playwright.
